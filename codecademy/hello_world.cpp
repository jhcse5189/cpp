/* Introduction to C++ */

/* C++ is a programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup 
 * at Bell Laboratories in 1979.
 * As the name implies, C++ was derived from the C language;
 * Bjarneâ€™s goal was to add object-oriented programming into C,
 * a language well-respected for its portability and low-level functionality.
 *
 * It is fast and flexible.
 * It is well-supported.
 * It forces you to think in new and creative ways.
